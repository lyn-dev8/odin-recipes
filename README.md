# Odin Recipes Project

This project involves creating a basic recipe website using HTML. It includes building an index page that links to multiple recipe pages and organizing them into directories. The project focuses on applying foundational HTML skills, such as:

- Creating HTML structure with boilerplate code
- Using heading elements and links for navigation
- Structuring content with unordered and ordered lists
- Adding images and text content for a recipe description, ingredients, and steps

By completing this project, I practiced creating well-organized webpages and linking them efficiently. This assignment reinforces the importance of clean, navigable structure in web design.
